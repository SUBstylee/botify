![# botify](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robinfriedli/botify/master/resources-public/img/botify-logo-wide.png)
 Discord bot that plays Spotify tracks and YouTube videos or any URL including Soundcloud links and Twitch streams.
 
 ## **Bot commands**
 
 ### Use these commands in '#bot-commands' channel on discord server.
 
 Check back for future additions.
 
 **Botify commands start with `$botify`.  This keyword can be changed in `$botify property` (will update later how to do this).**
 
- ### **BEFORE STARTING** Make sure you normalize volume (please do this and all commmands in #bot-commands channel, to keep server clean).  The range is 1-200.  Setting the volume to '10' seems to be a good starting point. From there, adjust the user volume on the bot manually in Discord.

    `$botify volume 10`

- ### Playing a spotify playlist
    1. Make sure you are in a voice channel and **YOU HAVE NORMALIZED VOLUME BEFORE PLAYING!**
    2. Use the `play` command followed by the playlist url (there are a few in the #bot-commands channel you can use, or use your own)
    
    `$botify play PLAYLIST_URL`
    
    This will show a message with details about what is playing now and the next song.  Using reactions, you can go to previous track, play/pause, or go to next track.  There are also commands for these actions.
    
- ### Playlist commands
    - `$botify play`
    
        Plays the current playlist. If paused, it will unpause the playlist.  If it is already playing, restarts current song.
    - `$botify pause`
    
        Pauses the current playlist. 
    - `$botify skip`
    
        Goes to next track on the current playlist.
    - `$botify rewind`
    
        Goes to previous track on the current playlist.
    - `$botify shuffle`
    
        Toggles shuffle on the current playlist. (sometimes this will carry over if you put on another playlist)
    - `$botify repeatall`
    
        Toggles repeat on the current playlist.
    - `$botify repeatone`
    
        Toggles repeat on the current song.
    - `$botify clear`
    
        Empties the playlist, leaving only the currently playing song.
    - `$botify stop`
    
        Stops the player and removes botify from the voice channel it is in.
    - `$botify queue`
    
        This will show you a queue for the current playlist.
        - Displays current playlist settings
        - Link to full list of songs
        - The 5 previous songs
        - the currently playing song
        - the next 5 songs
        
        Using reactions, you can toggle shuffle, previous, play/pause, next, repeat all, and repeat one.

## Invite it to your guild

https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=483377420494176258&permissions=70315072&scope=bot

## Host it yourself

### 1. Create a Discord app

#### 1.1 Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications and create an application
#### 1.2 Click "Bot" on the side menu to create a bot and copy the token for later

### 2. Create a Spotify app

#### 2.1 Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications to create a Spotify application and copy the client id
#### 2.2 Click on "Edit Settings" and whitelist your Redirect URI for the Spotify login
Don't have a domain? You could either go without logins all together and still use most of botify's features or use your
router's public ip and setup port forwarding for your router.

### 3. Create a YouTube Data API project
#### 3.1 Go to https://console.developers.google.com/ and create a project for the YouTube Data API and create and copy the credentials

### 4. Setup botify settings
#### 4.1 Navigate to your cloned project and go to `./resources` and open the `settings.properties` file and fill in the blanks, it should look like this:
#### 4.2 To take advantage of the admin commands that can perform administrative actions, such as updating and restarting the bot, be sure to add your Discord user id to the `ADMIN_USERS` property. To find your Discord user id, enable Developer Mode in the App Settings > Appearance. Then go to any guild, right click your user and click "Copy ID".
#### 4.3 For Botify to manage the YouTube API quota automatically, be sure to fill in the `YOUTUBE_API_DAILY_QUOTA` property; open the Google developer console and go to Library > YouTube Data API v3 > Manage > Quotas
#### 4.4 Change the `BASE_URI` property to your domain or public IP (without slash at the end) and adjust `REDIRECT_URI` to the corresponding endpoint for Spotify logins (normaly BASE_URI + "/login")
Don't have a domain? You could either go without a web server all together and still use most of botify's features or use your
router's public ip and setup port forwarding for your router to the machine where you're running botify via the port specified by the `SERVER_PORT` property.

### 5. Setup database
#### 5.1 Setup hibernate configuration
Navigate to `./resources/hibernate.cfg.xml` and adjust the settings, if you use a local postgres server and name your
database "botify_playlists" you can leave it like this:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-configuration PUBLIC
    "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Configuration DTD 3.0//EN"
    "http://www.hibernate.org/dtd/hibernate-configuration-3.0.dtd">

  </session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>
```
If you need help setting up your postgres server, please refer to their official documentation: http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/

#### 5.2 Setup liquibase properties
Go to `src/main/resources/liquibase/liquibase.properties` and adjust the liquibase properties according to the changes you made
to the hibernate configuration above. If you left it as it is you can leave the liquibase.properties like this:
```properties
driver=org.postgresql.Driver
url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/botify_playlists
username=postgres
password=postgres
changeLogFile=src/main/resources/liquibase/dbchangelog.xml
```

### 6 Compile and run botify
Navigate to the project root directory and install botify by running `mvn clean install`. Then you can launch botify
using the main class `net.robinfriedli.botify.boot.Launcher`. You can either run the bash script `resources/bash/launch.sh`
or run `java -jar target/botify-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` or `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=net.robinfriedli.botify.boot.Launcher` directly.
Note that this command is written for Unix-like operating systems such as macOS and Linux. For windows you might need to adjust this command to
`mvn exec:java -D"exec.mainClass"="net.robinfriedli.botify.boot.Launcher"`.
